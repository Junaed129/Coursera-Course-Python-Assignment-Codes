#Week 2 Assignment
#Finding Numbers in a Haystack

#In this assignment you will read through and parse a file with text and numbers. You will extract all the numbers in the file and compute the sum of the numbers.
#Data Files
#We provide two files for this assignment. One is a sample file where we give you the sum for your testing and the other is the actual data you need to process for 
#the assignment.
#Sample data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/regex_sum_42.txt (There are 90 values with a sum=445833)
#Actual data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/regex_sum_1063347.txt (There are 91 values and the sum ends with 228)
#These links open in a new window. Make sure to save the file into the same folder as you will be writing your Python program. 
#Note: Each student will have a distinct data file for the assignment - so only use your own data file for analysis.

#Code
import re
_sum=0;
_count=0;
hand = open('actual.txt')
for line in hand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    stuff=re.findall('[0-9]+',line)
    lenght=len(stuff)
    if lenght>=1:
        #s=s+sum((stuff))
        _count=_count+lenght
        for i in range(lenght):
            _sum=_sum+int(stuff[i])
print("Notal number count:",_count)
print("Summation of the numbers:",_sum)
